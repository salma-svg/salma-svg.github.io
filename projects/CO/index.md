### Combinatorial Optimization

Design and Implementation of a Solution to Optimize Internal Logistics for an Industrial Workshop

**Objective**:  
This project aimed to develop an optimized solution for managing the internal logistics of an industrial workshop. The goal was to streamline processes, minimize inefficiencies, and enhance the overall workflow within the facility by leveraging advanced optimization techniques.

**Skills and Tools Used**:

- **AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language)**: Utilized to model and solve the optimization problem through mathematical formulations.
  
- **Local Search Heuristic Methods**: Applied to explore potential solutions and improve system efficiency by iteratively refining the logistics processes based on neighboring solutions in the solution space.
  
- **Metaheuristic Methods**: Employed advanced algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization, or Tabu Search to overcome local optima in high dimension problems and find globally optimal or near-optimal solutions for the logistics problem.

**Outcomes**:  
Through a combination of heuristic and metaheuristic techniques, the project successfully improved the internal logistics of the workshop. The developed solution reduced bottlenecks, optimized resource allocation, and enhanced operational flow.

This project demonstrates my expertise in combinatorial optimization, problem-solving, and the application of advanced techniques to real-world industrial challenges.
