# Optimization with Constraint Learning

Welcome to the **Optimization with Constraint Learning** project. This initiative was developed as part of my internship with 'Fonderie de Niederbronn'. The goal is to optimize iron casting recipes by minimizing costs while ensuring product quality. This involves leveraging advanced constraint learning techniques and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on optimizing raw material usage for iron casting by balancing cost and quality. The key steps are:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Process and clean the raw data provided by the company. This includes joining datasets and extracting relevant features.
2. **Data Import**: Load data related to raw materials and production constraints.
3. **Model Prediction**: Apply predictive models to estimate mechanical properties, which can only be measured post-production.
4. **Optimization**: Determine the optimal mix of raw materials to minimize costs while adhering to quality constraints.
5. **Results Export**: Save the optimized results and predictions to Excel files for further analysis.
