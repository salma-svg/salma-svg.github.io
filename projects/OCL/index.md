# Optimization with Constraint Learning

Welcome to my **Optimization with Constraint Learning** project.
As part of my internship with 'Fonderie de Niederbronn', I had to find optimal reciepes to produce iron casts, by minimizing the pricing and assuring the quality of the products.
This project focuses on optimizing raw material usage through advanced constraint learning techniques and predictive models.

## Project Overview

This project involves optimizing the cost of raw materials based on chemical composition constraints and mechanical property predictions. The main steps include:

1. **Data cleaning** : Process the raw data given by the company, join and excract only necessary features. 
2. **Data Import**: Load data regarding raw materials and production constraints.
3. **Model Prediction**: Use predictive models to estimate mechanical properties (that can only be measured once the production is over).
4. **Optimization**: Optimize the material mix to minimize cost while meeting quality constraints.
5. **Results Export**: Save the results and predictions to Excel files.
