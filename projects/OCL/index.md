# Optimization with Constraint Learning

Welcome to the **Optimization with Constraint Learning** project. This project focuses on optimizing material usage through advanced constraint learning techniques and predictive models.

## Project Overview

This project involves optimizing the use of raw materials based on chemical composition constraints and mechanical property predictions. The main steps include:

1. **Data Import**: Load data regarding raw materials and constraints.
2. **Model Prediction**: Use predictive models to estimate mechanical properties.
3. **Optimization**: Optimize the material mix to minimize cost while meeting quality constraints.
4. **Results Export**: Save the results and predictions to Excel files.
