# Iron Casting Optimization with Constraint Learning

Welcome to the **Iron Casting Optimization with Constraint Learning** project. During my three months internship at **Fonderie de Niederbronn**, I focused on optimizing iron casting recipes. The goal was to minimize material costs while ensuring the highest quality of the final products. This project employs advanced constraint learning techniques and predictive modeling to achieve these objectives.

## Project Overview

The project is structured into several key phases:

1. **Data Cleaning**: We start by processing raw data provided by the company, including merging datasets and extracting essential features to prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Data Import**: Data related to raw materials and production constraints is loaded and prepared for use.
3. **Model Prediction**: Predictive models are employed to estimate mechanical properties that can only be measured after production.
4. **Optimization**: The material mix is optimized to reduce costs while adhering to quality constraints.
5. **Results Export**: Final results and predictions are saved and exported to Excel files for further use.

## Key Components

- **[Methodology](methodology.md)**: Detailed explanations of the algorithms and methods used in the project.
- **[Results](results.md)**: Insights and interpretations of the project results.
- **[Code](code.md)**: A comprehensive guide to the code structure and how to use it.
